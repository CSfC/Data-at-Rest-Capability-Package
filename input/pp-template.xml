      <h:p>The Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) Program within the National Security Agency (NSA)
      Capabilities Directorate publishes Capability Packages (CP) to provide architectures and configuration
      requirements that empower IA customers to implement secure solutions using independent, layered
      Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) products. The CPs are product-neutral and describe system-level
      solution frameworks, documenting security and configuration requirements for customers and/or
      Integrators. It is recommended that CSfC Trusted Integrators be employed to architect, design,
      integrate, test, document, field, and support the solution. The list of CSfC Trusted Integrators can be
      found at: https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/csfc/trusted-integrators.
      </h:p>
      
      <h:p>This generic CSfC Data-at-Rest (DAR) CP meets the demand for DAR solutions using Commercial National
      Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite. These algorithms are used to protect classified data using layers of
      COTS products. The DAR CP version 4.8 enables customers to implement two independent layers of
      encryption for the purpose of providing protection for stored information on the End User Device (EUD)
      or DAR protected system, while in a powered off or unauthenticated state, defined in Section 4.2.1. This
      CP takes lessons learned from one proof-of-concept demonstration per solution design that has
      implemented the CNSA Suite, modes of operation, standards, and protocols. These demonstrations
      included a layered use of COTS products for the protection of classified information.</h:p>
      
      <h:p>The DAR CP is focused on the implementation of cryptography to mitigate the risk to classified data from
      unauthenticated access when the device is powered off or unauthenticated. This CP does not protect
      against malicious code exploits and potential vulnerabilities from updates, operating system (OS)
      misconfigurations, or the persistence of remnants of key or plaintext material in volatile memory on the
      EUD when powered on, as these conditions are outside of the scope for this version of the CP.</h:p>
      
      <h:p>While CSfC encourages industry innovation, trustworthiness of the components is paramount.
      Customers and their Integrators are advised that modifying a National Information Assurance
      Partnership (NIAP)-validated component in a CSfC solution may invalidate its certification and require a
      revalidation process. To avoid delays, customers and Integrators who feel it is necessary to modify a
      component should engage the component vendor and consult NIAP through their Assurance Continuity
      Process (https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Documents_and_Guidance/ccevs/scheme-pub-6.pdf) to
      determine whether such a modification will affect the component’s certification.</h:p>
      
      <h:p>In case of a modification to a component, NSA’s CSfC Program Management Office (PMO) will require
      the component to successfully complete the NIAP Assurance Maintenance Continuity process.
      Modifications that will trigger the revalidation process include, but are not limited to: configuring the
      component in a manner different from its NIAP-validated configuration, and modifying the Original
      Equipment Manufacturers’ code (to include digitally signing the code).</h:p>

    <chapter title="Purpose and Use" id="purpose">
      <section>
        <h:p>This CP provides high-level reference designs and corresponding configuration requirements that allow
        customers to select COTS products from the CSfC Components List available on the CSfC web page
        (https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/csfc/components-list), for their DAR solution and then to
        properly configure those products to achieve a level of assurance sufficient for protecting classified data
        while at rest. As described in Section 9, customers must ensure that the components selected from the
        CSfC Components List will provide the necessary functionality for the selected capabilities. To
        successfully implement a solution based on this CP, all Threshold Requirements, or the corresponding
        Objective Requirements applicable to the selected capabilities, must be implemented, as described in
        Sections 8 - 12.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>This document, the CSfC Data-at-Rest CP version 4.8, dated October 2019, has not been approved by the
        Deputy National Manager (D/NM) for National Security Systems and is being released solely for the
        purpose of soliciting public comments.
        Please provide comments on usability, applicability, and/or shortcomings to your NSA/IA Client
        Advocate and the DAR Capability Package maintenance team at CSfC_DAR_team@nsa.gov. DAR CP
        solutions must also comply with the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) policies and
        instructions. Any conflicts between CNSS or local policy and this CP should be provided to the DAR CP
        Maintenance team.</h:p>

      <section title="Implementing CsfC in a High Assurance GOTS Environment" id="ImpGOTS">
        <h:p>Another option available to users of CSfC, is the concept of a blended solution that will use a CSfC
        solution, in combination with a High Assurance Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) solution. For these
        blended solutions, a High Assurance GOTS solution can be used to replace the entire function of a
        Capability Package as a whole, but not the individual layers of a solution or security functions provided
        by one of the layers. While CSfC uses two layers of encryption, this is not required with High Assurance
        GOTS, where a single layer of encryption is sufficient. For example, if desired, a CSfC DAR solution can
        be employed in an infrastructure where network High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptors (HAIPEs)
        are also being used. The DAR solution is segmented, and its protection is provided by CSfC, while the
        protection of the network that the information transits is provided by a High Assurance GOTS solution.

    <chapter title="Data-at-Rest Protection Overview" id="DARoverview">
      <section>
        <h:p>The goal of the DAR solution is to protect classified data when the EUD is powered off or
        unauthenticated. Unauthenticated, in this case, means prior to a user presenting and having their
        credentials (i.e., password, tokens, etc.) validated by both layers of the DAR solution. Specific data to be
        protected must be determined by the data owner.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>In this CP, when the term “EUD” is used, it is referring to anything that is being employed with two
        layers of CSfC DAR protection. Based on the context and wording of some of the CP language, other
        terms such as system, DAR solution, or device may be used. These terms can be used interchangeably
        depending on the context, the specific customer use case being implemented, and based on what the
        customer chooses to protect. This definition is further explained in detail in Section 5.5.</h:p>
      </section>
      <section title="Rational for Layered Encryption" id="RationalLayered">
        <h:p>A single layer of CNSA encryption, properly implemented, is sufficient to protect classified DAR. The
        DAR solution uses two layers of CNSA encryption, not because of a deficiency in the cryptographic
        algorithms, but rather to mitigate the risk that a failure in one of the cryptographic components: by
        accidental misconfiguration, operator error, or malicious exploitation of an implementation
        vulnerability, resulting in the exposure of classified information. The use of multiple layers,
        implemented with components meeting the CSfC vendor diversity requirements, reduces the likelihood
        that a single vulnerability can be exploited to reveal protected information.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>If one of the encryption layers is compromised or fails in some way, the second layer can still provide the
        needed encryption to safeguard the classified data. If both layers are compromised or fail
        simultaneously, it is possible the classified data will become readable to a threat actor. The goal of the
        DAR solution is to provide redundant protection that either minimizes the possibility of both layers
        failing at the same time or requires an adversary to defeat both mechanisms.</h:p>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Solution States" id="states">
        <h:p>The DAR solution states are identified and described in further detail in this section. Note, that once a
          device is considered classified (e.g., Powered-On with Outer Layer Authenticated State) it will not be
          considered unclassified (must still be handled in accordance with the implementing organizations’
          Authorizing Official (AO) policies) again until the device is powered-down.</h:p>
        <subsection title="EUD Solution States" id="eudstates">
          <h:b>Powered-Off State:</h:b>
          <h:p>In a powered-off state, the device is completely off and not in any power saving state. The EUD is
          considered unclassified, but must still be handled in accordance with the implementing organizations’
          AO policies. This applies to all removable media (RM) when unplugged from the host system. If the RMs
          have their own power states, the product documentation must be consulted to determine how to
          independently switch the product into a powered-off state.</h:p>
          
          <h:b>Powered-On and Unauthenticated State:</h:b>
          <h:p>In a powered-on and unauthenticated state, the EUD is completely on, but the user has not initially
          logged into either layer. The EUD is considered unclassified, but must be handled in accordance with
          the implementing organizations’ AO policies. This state cannot be entered by logging off after initial
          logon. This applies to all removable media when plugged into the host system.</h:p>
          
          <h:b>Powered-On with Outer Layer Authenticated State:</h:b>
          <h:p>In a powered-on state with the outer layer authenticated, the EUD is operational where the user has
          authenticated to the outer layer of encryption. The device in this state is considered classified and
          should be handled accordingly. This applies to all removable media when plugged into the host system.
          Powered-On with Outer and Inner-Layer Authenticated State:
          In a powered-on state with the outer and inner-layer authenticated, the EUD is operational when the
          user has authenticated to two layers of DAR encryption. The device in this state is considered classified
          and should be handled accordingly. This applies to all removable media when plugged into the host
          system.</h:p>
          
          <h:b>Locked or Logged Out State:</h:b>
          <h:p>In a locked or logged out state, the device is powered-on but most of the functionality is unavailable for
          use. User authentication is required to access functionality. This functions as an access control and may
          provide one layer of DAR protection. The device in this state is considered classified and should be
          handled accordingly. This applies to all removable media when plugged into the host system.</h:p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection title="Enterprise Management (EM) Server and Mission Control Element (MCE) Solution States" id="emstates">
          <h:b>Always on State:</h:b>
          <h:p>The “always on state” in this section applies to the server that is acting as part of a remote access
            architecture or a client-server architecture, controlling the DAR enterprise managed solution. This state
            does not apply to the server that is acting as a DAR EUD with two layers of protection. The “EUD
            Solution States,” described above in Section 4.2.1, is only applicable to a server, if that server is acting as
            the DAR EUD being provisioned with two encryption layers to protect the server’s storage. In this CP, it is
            assumed that the EM server, base station, or MCE will be protected within a secured facility, as
            prescribed by the AO (e.g., Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), secured room, etc.).
            This CP does not provide sufficient mechanisms to protect classified data on the EM server, unless that
            server is also treated as a DAR EUD and is protected with two layers of DAR. In an always on state, the
            DAR enterprise management server, the base station, or the Mission Control Element (MCE) is always
            powered on to keep processes up and running. Additional details about these components and
            solutions, can be found in Sections 5.6, 7.3, and 7.4.</h:p>

      <section title="DAR CNSA Suite" id="cnsa">
        <h:p>As the portability of EUDs increases, the requirements for when and how classified data is protected
        also increases. EUDs can be used in both physically protected and physically unprotected environments.
        Solutions using commercial products must protect classified data on the EUD by using two layers of
        encryption with the approved CNSA Suite. The solutions presented in this CP have specific requirements
        for configuration, product selection, components, provisioning, authentication, key management,
        operations, administration, roles, and use and handling.</h:p>

        <h:p>IA will initiate a transition to quantum resistant algorithms in the not too distant future. IA customers
          using layered commercial solutions to protect classified national security information with a long
          intelligence life should begin implementing a layer of quantum resistant protection. Such protection 
          may be implemented today through the use of large symmetric keys coupled with specific secure
          protocol standards. For more information please go to https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/iadinitiatives/cnsa-suite.cfm. </h:p>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Authentication" id="auth">
        <h:p>In the capability package, each layer is required to have a “known secret” (i.e., PIN, password, or
        passphrase), smartcard, or Universal Serial Bus (USB) token to authenticate to each of the two
        encryption layers. The permitted factors may differ based on the layer. DAR encryption products must
        meet requirements for each of these factors during evaluation against the applicable protection profile
        (PP). These are considered primary (validated) authentication factors for that component.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Many products offer alternate authentication mechanisms. When implementing the DAR solution,
        these alternate mechanisms may be used only as a secondary (non-validated) authentication factor and
        must be paired with a primary authentication factor. Secondary factors may act as an additional access
        control or may contribute to the product’s key chain; the product’s protection profile evaluation
        guarantees there is no loss in strength when combining keys with potentially weaker sources. A layer
        may use any number of authentication factors as long as one is a primary factor, as listed in that
        component’s specific authentication requirement. As an example, layer one may use a known secret
        (primary factor) along with a biometric (secondary factor), and layer two may use a smartcard. It is
        important to consider the requirements, benefits, and drawbacks associated with different
        authentication factors. Some considerations of popular factors are discussed below.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Known secrets are memorized values that can provide a strong authentication value if well chosen (see
        Appendix A) and are typically supported by almost all products. They are at risk of being forgotten, as
        well as being seen while being keyed into the device. The majority of the time, known secrets will be
        weaker than tokens and are at risk of being very weak if not properly chosen.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Smartcard tokens are small integrated circuit devices that can store authentication keys. As long as they
        are handled and stored properly, they provide a very strong form of authentication. They provide a
        flexible option for authenticating a user to many devices and providing additional security through the
        use of a PIN to use the card. Aside from the benefits, cards are susceptible to loss and damage. In
        addition, they may require a separate system for provisioning and recovery.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>USB tokens are a simple form of token that provides a very strong form of authentication as long as they
        are handled and stored properly. Although very easy to provision, they generally have no additional
        security features, unless the USB device itself provides those features. Unfortunately, they are not
        permitted in many places.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Biometric technology functions by taking a measurement of an element of the user’s body. Common
        examples are fingerprints, iris scans, and facial recognition. This measurement is compared against a
        template that is created during provisioning; if the measurement matches the template, the user is
        authenticated. The vendor may use this authentication as an access control or may release a key to
        contribute to decryption. If a key is used, it will be important to ask how that key is protected and what 
        authorizes the key’s release, as there are currently no methods being used to derive a biometric
        measurement into a key. When using biometrics there may be instances when unauthorized users will
        be authenticated to the biometric when they should not; this is called a false acceptance, and is a
        condition with which all biometrics have to contend. Customers should obtain vendors’ False
        Acceptance Rates (FAR) and determine how comprehensive their testing was to determine that rate.
        The other rate to address is the False Rejection Rate (FRR), which is when an authorized user’s
        measurements fail to authenticate. This is a usability concern and should also be discussed with the
        vendor. The biometric template used to compare measurements is intended to be constructed so that
        the user’s measurements are not reversible. If an adversary was able to obtain the template, they
        would be unable to reconstruct the user’s fingerprint. However, this is not always the case; templates
        are not well standardized and there have been cases of reconstruction. This may be a risk to the privacy
        of users. One of the major risks of biometric is spoofing. This involves using other technology to
        recreate the user’s measurement. Examples of spoofing include taking photos of the user’s face or
        lifting fingerprints. The vendor should explain how they mitigate spoofing, and users should protect the
        area being used to authenticate. Many biometrics need a fallback mechanism in case the area being
        used to authenticate to the biometric system becomes damaged, such as a finger being cut.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Consideration should be given to what the fallback mechanism is or the consequences if there is none.
        Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short range signal. Generally, the devices are placed adjacently or
        in contact to exchange information in this method. This signal can vary in how it is used during the
        authentication process. There may or may not be an exchange of key material. The details of what is
        exchanged will need to be discussed with the vendor. Regardless of what is exchanged, the devices
        should be kept apart and treated like a Smartcard or USB token. NFC may not be permitted if the
        solution must also comply with other CPs that don’t permit it.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Behavior based authentication covers a wide variety of features. The goal is to determine if an
        authorized user has the device, based on whether the device is being used and handled the way the
        authorized user normally uses the device. Based on this information the device may release a key,
        provide an access control, or allow for a longer time before locking the device. Factors that are taken
        into account, include: account are location, connected networks, gyroscope measurements, user
        interaction, and other internal sensors.</h:p>

      <section title="Continuous Physical Control" id="control">
        <h:p>Although the DAR solution can protect the confidentiality of data and render the EUD unclassified, it
        does not protect the integrity of an EUD outside the control of approved users. It is difficult to examine
        and determine whether or not a device has been tampered with; therefore, the EUD must remain in
        continuous physical control at all times. The NSA requires that implementing organizations define the
        circumstances in which an EUD that is part of the solution is considered outside of the continuous
        physical control of authorized users (i.e., "lost"). The AO will define “continuous physical control”, and
        this definition should align with the intended mission and threat environment for which the solution will
        be deployed. Each organization must also define the circumstances in which an EUD that is a part of the 
        solution is to be considered recovered, and into the continuous physical control of authorized users (i.e.,
        "found").</h:p>
        
        <h:p>This concept includes mechanisms for the Unattended Operations Use Case (described in Section 7.4).
        AO’s should have a variety of mechanisms to ensure control of the EUD is maintained via cameras,
        sensors, and other similar means. The exact means are out of scope of the DAR CP, but there should be
        a high degree of confidence that the EUD is not susceptible to unauthorized access.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>This CP requires any lost device, once found, to be rigorously investigated and/or destroyed in order to
        mitigate threats to the integrity of the EUD and any connected systems, because upon being found, the
        device is considered not secure unless the device meets Lost and Found (LF) requirements that are
        indicated as “LF” in the Use Case column in the requirements table. AOs should consult the DAR CP Risk
        Assessment (RA) to help make an informed risk decision.</h:p>

      <section title="Red, Gray, and Black Data" id="rgb">
        <h:p>This CP uses the following terminology to describe the data types that compose a DAR solution. The
        terms Red, Gray, and Black identify the number of encryption layers applied to classified data for a
        specific EUD state.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Red data is unencrypted classified data being processed by the EUD. After a user successfully
        authenticates to the outer and inner layers of DAR encryption, the EUD is in a state of processing Red
        data.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Gray data contains classified information that has been encrypted once. After a user successfully
        authenticates to the outer layer of DAR encryption, but has not yet authenticated to the inner layer of
        encryption, the EUD is in a state of processing Gray data.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Black data contains classified information that has been encrypted twice. An EUD is considered black
        when the device is powered off and/or unauthenticated and the stored data has been encrypted with
        both the outer and inner layers of DAR encryption.</h:p>

      <section title="Cryptographic Erase (CE)" id="ce">
        <h:p>Cryptographic Erase (CE), is a method of sanitization in which an encryption key for the encrypted data
        is sanitized, making recovery of the decrypted data infeasible. In this document CE is used to ensure
        clean re-provisioning, as an additional protection triggered by a failed authentication, or as an
        emergency method of sanitizing the media, in the event proper destruction methods cannot be met (see
        DAR-EU-2 in Table 12).</h:p>
      </section>
      
      <section title="Provisioning" id="provisioning">
        <h:p>Provisioning is the process through which EUDs are initialized before first use. During the provisioning
          process, the Security Administrator (SA) loads and configures the DAR components for the EUD.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Provisioning is inherently an out-of-band process requiring physical access to the EUD. The DAR solution
        cannot be applied to an EUD that already has data stored on it.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>EUD re-provisioning or reuse of DAR components is allowed as long as it is performed in accordance
        with this CP. If re-provisioning, the EUD must be at the same or higher classification level of the
        previous unencrypted data stored on the approved DAR solution. Prior to re-provisioning an EUD, old
        data should be removed via cryptographic erase or media zeroization. Re-provisioning EUD components
        from any non-CSfC solution is prohibited. </h:p>

      <section title="Secure File Deletion" id="delete">
        <h:p>When deleting files via normal means (i.e., deleting followed by emptying the recycle bin, shift + delete,
          etc.) from the computer, there is a possibility for residual data to remain on the underlying storage
          media for extended periods of time, recoverable by forensic techniques. While the DAR CP requires
          multiple layers of encryption and tries to mitigate user error, it is still possible for the device to be
          compromised; in that event, securely deleting files reduces the information available to the adversary.
          For these reasons, it is recommended to use applications to securely delete files.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Secure file deletion tools make use of more direct methods to mitigate the risk of data being
          recoverable. Since there is not currently a method of validation for providing secure file deletion, here
          are some recommendations for features to include when acquiring a secure file deletion product. When
          looking for a product to fulfill this purpose, the type of storage media must be considered. There are
          currently two primary storage drives used today, hard disk drives (HDD) and solid state drives (SSD).
          Flash USB drives fall into the same area as SSDs.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>Normally when a file is deleted from a HDD, the reference to that file’s content is removed. The
          majority of the data will continue to reside on the disk, being treated as free space for new data to use.
          This makes the role of a third party product straightforward. It should claim to directly overwrite the file
          reference and file data with any value, as long as that value cannot contain sensitive data, such as the
          contents of random access memory (RAM). Products may provide options for performing multiple
          passes, but is not necessary, as a single pass provides sufficient security. However, if only multiple
          passes are supported, they will not cause any harm.</h:p>
        
        <h:p>In order to understand the residual risk, it is important to understand the basics of the complications
          involved in erasing memory from a SSD. When a user deletes a file, the drive will mark that area as free
          space, but will not actually overwrite the data. This is for performance reasons, the memory used by the
          SSD must be cleared before being written to again, which takes time. The drive works in conjunction
          with the operating system to perform this task in the background when the drive does not have more
          important tasks. Because of this, it is not possible for a third party file deletion tool to directly overwrite
          data. There is also an upside, as regular deletion can eventually result in a direct overwrite, unlike HDDs
          where the data can remain for long periods of time. Because of this, third party tools are not necessary,
          and files may be deleted via normal means. However, there are other factors that effect when the SSD
          drive’s background overwrite process can take place. The restrictions below detail configurations which 
          a user can exert control. There are other situations where a user cannot exert control, which has the
          potential to result in data residing on the SSD for an extended undefined period of time. This is
          acceptable since any residual data should be encrypted. If any of the restrictions below apply, some
          third party products may be able to overcome them. Otherwise, the product should issue commands
          that enable the SSD to clear memory as soon as possible.</h:p>
        
        <h:ul>
          <h:li>TRIM, the command issued to the SSD to clear space, may not be supported by the operating
          system. Most modern operating systems do support this command; check operating system
          documentation to ensure support for TRIM.</h:li>
         <h:li>The TRIM command may only be supported by the OS if certain file systems are being used.
          Check vendor documentation to ensure a compatible file system is used.</h:li>
         <h:li>The way this is checked varies between operating systems. Check operating system
          documentation on how to verify TRIM is enabled.</h:li>
         <h:li>Older SSDs may not support the TRIM command. The majority of modern drives do have
          support; check vendor documentation to ensure the device supports this command.</h:li>
         <h:li>The operating system may not support TRIM for external drives, USB flash drives, or other
          devices connected over USB, PCI E, M.2 and other interfaces. This is a common area where a
          third party product may provide additional benefit.</h:li>
         <h:li>The operating system may not support TRIM when a Redundant Array of Independent Disks
          (RAID) configuration is used.</h:li>
        </h:ul>
          
          <h:p>DAR products that support encrypted volumes may interfere with the TRIM command for data within
          the volumes. Some products do enable TRIM to function within the encrypted volumes, check vendor
          documentation for verification</h:p>

      <section title="DAR Location Based Services" id="location">
        <h:p>Data-at-Rest protection can include capabilities that restrict access and authorization to a device based
          on the EUD’s location, through the use of location aware technology. In this CP, a customer has the
          option of employing DAR location aware technology as an added feature to a DAR solution. This does
          not replace either of the two mandatory encryption layers required in a CSfC DAR solution, but is only
          used as a supplemental means of protection, for defense in depth. Currently, there are no PPs to
          validate this type of technology. If customers choose to implement DAR location services, the customer
          should consult with the vendor and ask about specific details concerning the mechanisms and
          methodologies used in their product.</h:p>
        
          <h:p>DAR location services provides for precise geolocation of DAR devices using methods such as, WPS (WiFi Positioning System), GPS (Global Positioning System), and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). WPS
          achieves precision geolocation using a layered approach and may provide more accurate and reliable
          geolocation for DAR systems that are operated within a building, whereas GPS may be effective in
          outdoor locations. The precision geolocation of a DAR device configured for a DAR location service is a
          precursor to successfully managing a variety of unattended secure DAR storage operations through the
          location aware storage domain. These storage operations include:</h:p>
        
        <h:ul>
          <h:li>Storage function isolation to minimize possibility of interference</h:li>
          <h:li>Reliable location determination within 802.11 wireless environments</h:li>
          <h:li>Location driven DAR operation that can only be operated within fixed boundaries</h:li>
          <h:li>Secure domain within a building driven by security policy</h:li>
        </h:ul>
          
          <h:p>DAR RFID based mobility services provides an added layer of assurance to DAR mobility by enabling
          administrators to track and control the location and movement of DAR devices within the confines of a
          building or enclave. This may be achieved by creating policies for individual devices depending on one
          or more of the following mobility related parameters:</h:p>
          
          <h:ul>
        <h:li>Physical location – Maintain continued device location status and confirm that uninterrupted
          physical control (as defined by the AO) is in effect.</h:li>
         Network connectivity – Provide validation of device presence within approved spaces for preboot and decryption.
        <h:li>Time-based operation –Revoke keys and initiate full-disk erase if the device remains outside of
          approved spaces beyond an authorized time period.</h:li>
        <h:li>Encryption enforcement –Initiate a power down or a key revocation to enforce DAR encryption
          when a device is removed from approved spaces.</h:li>
          </h:ul>
        
          
          <h:p>When a device exceeds or violates any of the mobility related parameters, the RFID based service
          executes appropriate measures to ensure the integrity and security of data stored in the device are
          maintained. These measures can include key revocation, crypto erase, device power down, etc. </h:p>

        The TOE boundary encompasses the OS kernel and its drivers, shared
        software libraries, and some application software included with the OS. The applications considered within the TOE
        are those that provide essential security services, many of which run with elevated
        privileges.  Applications which are covered by more-specific Protection Profiles cannot
        claim evaluation as part of the OS evaluation, even when it is necessary to evaluate
        some of their functionality as it relates to their role as part of the OS.

      The Security Objectives in 
      <secref linkend="obj"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
      <secref linkend="threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s)
      in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <h:br/> This section lists the set of <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      <!--(AAs). Never use these again --> to be performed are specified both in <secref
        linkend="req"/> as well as in this section. <h:br/> The general model for evaluation of <abbr
        linkend="OS"/>s against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <h:br/> After the
        <abbr linkend="ST"/> has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded"
        title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain the
        <abbr linkend="OS"/>, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP. <subsection title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">As per ASE activities
        defined in <cite linkend="bibCEM"/>.</subsection>
      <subsection title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> portion of the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. The <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> should provide the <abbr linkend="ST"/> authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.

          functional specification describes the <abbr title="TSF Interface">TSFI</abbr>s. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because <abbr linkend="OS"/>s conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by <abbr linkend="OS"/>
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. <h:br/>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the “pass” result.</aactivity>

  <!-- Remove this section if an Entropy Assessment is not needed -->
  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> This appendix
    describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. <h:br/>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product. <h:br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <h:br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <h:br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy. <h:br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. <h:br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output. <h:br/> For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. <h:br/>
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete. <h:br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
      third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source. </section>
